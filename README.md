How FinTech Secures APIs
This project explains how financial technology (FinTech) companies secure their APIs to protect user data.  

## Key Security Concepts  
- **Authentication**: Using API keys, OAuth, or JWT tokens.  
- **Encryption**: Securing data in transit and at rest.  
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse with request limits.  
- **Monitoring**: Detecting threats using logging and alerts.
